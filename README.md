# databases
A repository containing databases developed in the Brune lab.

These databases are compatible with the [mothur](https://github.com/mothur/mothur/) software and can be used with the [classify.seqs](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/Classify.seqs) command.

If you use the Oxymonadida and/or Parabasalia databases, please cite [Efficient but occasionally imperfect vertical transmission of gut mutualistic protists in a wood‐feeding termite](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15322) (Michaud et al, 2020, Molecular Ecology, 29:308–324).

Regarding the archaeal database, we provide both mothur-formatted and arb files. If you use this database, please cite *Protasov et al. Submitted*.
